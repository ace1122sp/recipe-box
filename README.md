issue: if you are using Chrome, after you click Get Started button and the app opens it shows nothing and you need to click on the header a couple of times and buttons will appear.
This is a bug which has appeared after Chrome had changed,and it has something to do with animations.
As soon as possible I'm gonna fix the bug.. cheers :D
